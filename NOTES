		   IRRd 2.1.2  Release notes

  The 2.1.2 release fixes a bug in irr_rpsl_submit which resulted in the
  process exiting prematurely on Linux (due to a redundant fclose() call).
  There was also a bug in the configure script which resulted in PGP not
  being correctly enabled on systems with PGP/GnuPG binaries.  Manual updates
  have also been made to correct an erroneous documentation concerning
  invoking irr_rpsl_submit via email submissions and the use of the "-D" flag.
  Also note that irr_rpsl_submit must be able to update the PGP directory and
  ring files in order to support PGP authentication.

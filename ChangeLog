	* src/lib/mrt/user.c:	Fix use of wrong variable name for uii
	structure.

2001-08-07 16:04  ljb

	* src/lib/mrt/user_util.c:   UII did not work under Linux.  The
	scheduling of threads is handled
	differently under Linux than Solaris with new threads being run
	before control is returned to the parent process (Solaris behaves
	in the opposite manner).  This results in uii->schedule->self not
	being set when uii_send_buffer is called.   Do a trivial fix for
	this.

2001-08-07 16:00  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/scan.c:   Add *i6: short form of inet6num
	object.

2001-08-07 15:23  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/telnet.c:	Need to reset timeval struct before

	IRRD_VERSION.

2001-08-07 13:09  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/main.c:    remove -p flag as it does not
	currently do anything.	Fix -x flag so
	it actually does something.  Add -g and -l flags to allow setting
	the group and user id's, respectively.	Change MRT_VERSION to
	IRRD_VERSION.

2001-08-07 13:04  ljb

	* src/include/version.h:   New version number for IRRd

2001-08-06 13:42  ljb

	to purify version of irrd.

2001-08-06 13:37  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/telnet.c:	 When closing whois port
	connection, delete_schedule was called
	instead of destroy_schedule which resulted in a memory leak.  The
	schedule struct is not needed at all in a threaded configuration. 
	Conditional compile out the schedule struct for threaded
	compilation.

2001-08-06 13:33  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/irrd.h:	Reduce size of MIRROR_BUFFER

2001-08-06 13:33  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/scan.c:    remove setvbuf call which was
	allocating 400K per database.  adjust
	some buffer sizes to reduce stack usage.  journal_irr_update called
	with db_offset uninitialized which caused purify to complain.

2001-08-06 13:30  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/main.c:   Format error for "kill" command.

2001-08-06 13:29  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/irrd_util.c:   Just some format clean-ups.

2001-08-06 13:27  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/config.c:	 Clean-up some mem-leaks in some of
	the config commands.

2001-08-06 13:02  ljb

	* src/lib/mrt/user.c:	uii was calling delete_schedule instead of
	destroy_schedule on connection
	close.	This resulted in a memory leak for every uii connection.

2001-08-06 13:01  ljb

	* src/lib/mrt/schedule.c:   New_schedule did 2 strdup's if
	description was NULL without freeing
	the results of the first strdup.

2001-07-27 12:59  ljb

	* src/lib/radix/: demo.c, radix.c:   A couple files that missed the
	conversion for DOS to UNIX end-of-line
	convention.

2001-07-17 12:44  gerald

	* src/programs/pgp/pgp.c: 
	Test.  Added a comment.

2001-07-17 11:35  ljb

	* src/programs/irr_ripe181_check/prefix.c:   Missed commit on this
	for IPV6 support patch.  Does the RIPE181 code
	matter anymore?

2001-07-13 15:15  ljb

	* src/programs/IRRd/: Makefile, atomic_trans.c, commands.c,
	config.c, database.c, db1_support.c, dbm_support.c, irrd.h,

	sys/types.h and unistd.h for compiling on FreeBSD.

2001-07-13 14:43  ljb

	* src/programs/irr_notify/Makefile:   Update Makefile to link with
	compat library.

	* src/programs/hdr_comm/: hdr_comm.c, read_conf.c:    Portability
	fixes.	Include unistd.h in  hdr_comm.c and add prototype
	for snprintf in read_conf.c.

2001-07-13 14:19  ljb

	* src/programs/atomic_ops/atomic_ops.c:    Fix for my_cp and my_mv
	commands which were resulting in zombie
	processes due to a the lack of a waitpid call in parent process. 
	Changing these function to use internal code to accomplish moves
	and copies rather than forking and execing mv and cp Unix commands.

2001-07-13 14:17  ljb

2001-06-14 15:12  ljb

	* src/programs/irr_rpsl_check/irr_attrs.c:   Don't redefine
	MAX_COUNTRIES in here.	util.c is getting value from
	irr_rpsl_check.h.   Should probably make this a NULL terminated
	array.	Why is this array currently empty?

2001-06-14 15:10  ljb

	* src/include/irr_rpsl_check.h:   countries[] array currently has
	zero entries.	MAX_COUNTRIES should match
	number entries.  Why not use a NULL terminated array?

2001-06-12 16:06  ljb

	* src/programs/irr_submit/call_pipeline.c:    Neglected in include

	-irrdcacher  Reversed a recent change from '/private/tmp' to
	'/var/tmp' which  it uses for a temp dir.  Needs to match the irrd

	-pgpchk.c  changed pgpdecodefile () to pgpdecodefile_new () which
	is the	new pgp code we should be using.

	* src/: include/irr_rpsl_check.h,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/syntax_attrs.c,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/util.c: 
	* relaxed the handle syntax checking to allow for all	the new
	cases that keep popping up.  Also the check   is case-insensitive
	now to conform to rpsl.
	
	  Basically the only checking we do now is...
	
	  1. handle has at least 5 characters
	  2. no special character other than '-',
	  3. must start with an alpha
	  4. cannot end in an '-'.

	IRRd/rpsl_commands.c, IRRd/telnet.c, irrdcacher/irrdcacher: 
	* Eliminated the security hole from the new irrdcacher.   
	irrdcacher now uses the temp dir from the irrd.conf file    instead
	of a command line option.
	
	  Also, made irrdcacher run only on the local machine (ie,
	  it telnets to 'localhost' and is no longer a command lin
	  option.
	
	* updated irrd with the new !B syntax:
	
	  !B<comma seperated list of DB's>

	Added access list check on the irr_port

2000-11-14 11:13  gerald

	* src/: include/pgp.h, programs/IRRd/telnet.c, programs/pgp/pgp.c: 
	* decreased connection timeout from 5 minutes to 1 minute.
	
	* WIP on the pgp lib to convert the exec call to avoid	 ring perms
	problem. (not as easy as you would think)

2000-10-30 13:42  gerald

	* src/programs/: IRRd/journal.c, irr_rpsl_check/dictionary.c: 
	* Fixed a static buffer problem in dictionary.c which would  
	overflow on long strings.

	* src/programs/: IRRd/uii_commands.c, irrdcacher/irrdcacher: 
	* added comments to uii_commands.c
	
	* udpated irrdcacher to assume everything to import   is a DB and
	to auto-fetch *.CURRENTSERIALS if they	 exist.  Also updated the
	!B invokation to conform to   the new semantics.

2000-10-17 16:36  gerald

	* src/programs/rps_dist/mirror_update.c: 
	* small fix to finish off the last bug to get the !us...!ue right.

2000-10-17 15:19  gerald

	* src/programs/: irr_notify/notify.c, rps_dist/mirror_update.c: 
	* added some comments in nofify.c
	
	* fixed an rpsdist function responsbile for sending IRRd the  
	!us...!ue command.  Removed function sensitivity to user  
	formatting (which would cause irrd to barf).

2000-10-16 12:18  gerald

	* src/programs/: IRRd/database.c, irr_submit/call_pipeline.c: 
	* added 'strerror' fun call to the export process to get more  
	info on why exports are failing.
	
	* reverted back to old pgp initial decode fun due to perms problem 
	 with the execl call.

	* src/programs/rps_dist/: init_utils.c, mirror_update.c, rpsdist.c,
	rpsdist.h, user_update.c, utils.c: 
	  - Removed some random printfs
	  - Fixed trace (and a file naming error)
	  - Made it so lost connections to mirrors are auto
	    re-established
	  - When a mirror connection is made, the mirror repository
	    makes sure it's up to date by sending a !j, and requesting
	    any transactions it does't have.
	  - Fixed lotsa trace messages
	  - (only minimally tested)

2000-10-13 20:41  polandj

	* src/programs/IRRd/commands.c: When removing !ms, I forgot one
	rather important piece...

	* src/programs/: IRRd/irrd_util.c, irr_notify/Makefile,
	irr_rpsl_check/Makefile, irr_submit/Makefile, pgp/Makefile,

2000-09-26 20:57  polandj

	* src/include/read_conf.h: the h file.
	
	I think something weird just happened with the versions of
	read_conf.c..
	
	 CVS:
	-------------------------------------------------------------------

2000-09-26 20:55  polandj

	* src/programs/hdr_comm/read_conf.c: The latest read_conf checkin. 
	Proovides some new rpsdist commands that Jerry already put into the
	IRRd parser.
	
	There's one added thing to the read_conf.h, which I'll add next.

2000-09-26 20:02  gerald

	* src/programs/: hdr_comm/hdr_comm.c, irr_submit/comdata.c,
	irr_submit/mailchk.c, irr_submit/main.c: 
	* Bug fix in the mail header processing pipeline module.  We   were
	looking for a blankline between the email header and the   body of
	the message by checking for a '\n'.  The bug would   show up in a
	case like this ' \n'.  fixed the check with   a regular expression
	to encompass all blank line representations.

2000-09-21 18:14  gerald

	* src/programs/: IRRd/commands.c, IRRd/scan.c, IRRd/update.c,
	irr_submit/call_pipeline.c: 
	* Added more logging statements and fixed some of the lame   one's
	we had in there.  Gettting a statement from strerror   'No such
	file or directory' is about as helpful as a hole   in the head.

2000-09-20 19:55  gerald

	* src/programs/: IRRd/config.c, IRRd/irrd_prototypes.h,
	IRRd/main.c, hdr_comm/hdr_comm.c, irr_notify/notify.c,
	irr_submit/pgpchk.c, irrd_ops/Makefile: 
	* bug fix in the pgp processing module.
	
	* expanded the syntax in the irrd parser for the   rpsdist config
	commands.

	programs/irr_rpsl_check/syntax_attrs.c,
	programs/irr_submit/call_pipeline.c, programs/irr_submit/main.c,
	programs/pgp/pgp.c: 
	* bug fix when adding keys with expiration date instead   of
	indefinte.
	
	* removed some old pgp code from the synatx checker.
	
	* turned on the new pgp code in call_pipeline.c.  this code  
	accepts detached sig's, has some bug fixes and was re-written	to
	use the pgp lib.

2000-09-11 12:08  polandj

	* src/programs/rps_dist/: Makefile, file_utils.c, init_utils.c,
	mirror_update.c, old_code.c, rpsdist.c, rpsdist.h, select.c,
	update.c, user_update.c, utils.c: This checkin does the following: 
	  - Fixes a SIGPIPE problem after a long time with no updates	 -
	Allows for adding databases on the fly (completely untested)	-
	Fixes problem with Transaction request responses being buffered,
	and	 therefore not processed right when you want them to be.   
	 - Allows mirrors who aren't auth for a DB to connect to us, but
	they	   cannot send to us.	  - Keeps track of who sent to a
	transaction to us, we don't resend it to       them.	 - Drops
	transaction requests we cannot satisfy	   - Other stuff I've
	forgotten

2000-09-05 23:23  gerald

	* src/: include/read_conf.h, programs/IRRd/config.c,
	programs/IRRd/irrd.h, programs/IRRd/irrd_prototypes.h,
	programs/IRRd/main.c, programs/hdr_comm/read_conf.c,
	programs/irr_submit/main.c: 
	* Fixed the irrd.conf file so that we could configure for   rpsdist
	and co-exist with irrd.
	
	* rpsdist DB's can be configured with 3 commands:
	
	rpsdist_database <dbname> [trusted host port hexid]
	rpsdist_database <dbname> authoritative hexid pgppass
	rpsdist_database <dbname> accept host
	
	* also wrote coresponding parse functions for the irrd.conf  
	parser for the pipeline.
	
	This scheme allows co-existence between irrd styly mirroring and
	rpsdist mirroring.  At some point when we are 100% rpsdist
	compliant we can remove the conf support for the irrd related
	commands.

2000-09-05 10:42  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/commands.c: Fixed buffer overflows

2000-09-04 12:57  gerald

	* src/programs/IRRd/: Makefile, atomic_trans.c, commands.c,
	irrd_prototypes.h, journal.c, main.c, scan.c: 
	* Added a new module 'atomic_trans.c' which has all the atomic
	transaction support functions bundled together.
	
	* finished initial testing/coding of the transaction support  
	mechanism.  The '-a' irrd command line flag must be selected   to
	turn on transaction support.
	
	Features: 1. if a transaction cannot be applied in it's entirety
	irrd	will rollback the DB (and journal if necessary) to it's   
	original state prior to the transaction.  An error message    is
	propagated back to the user.
	
	2. if the system crashes during a transaction irrd will be able   
	to return the DB to a consistent state upon bootstrap.
	
	   If the transaction did not finish, irrd will re-apply the update
	   to the DB on bootstrap.  By examining a special transaction file
	   irrd will be able to tell at what point a transaction failed
	   and be able to re-apply the transaction.

2000-08-31 13:49  gerald

	atomic_ops/atomic_ops.c, irr_notify/notify.c,
	irr_submit/call_pipeline.c: 
	This is the work over the last week or so for the atomic
	transaction support for IRRd.
	
	It *should* be out of the way.	To cause IRRd use atomic
	transactions you invoke it with the '-a' command line flag.
	
	However, I did have to touch a few line of the irrd code.  eg, I
	rewrote the write_irr_serial () function from void to int so that I
	could call it and know if it was successfull.  To do this I had to
	change the system file calls.
	
	So we should proceed with caution before deploying it.	Jon and I
	are testing and will get plenty of cycles in to make sure no new
	bugs have been introduced.

	* src/programs/: Makefile, IRRd/config.c, IRRd/main.c,

	* Minor tweak in the regular expression for passwords.
	
	* Fixed compile bug in which we were building irrd before  
	atomic_ops lib on which it relies.
	
	* Fixed a 'strncpy' bug; we were omitting the '\0' terminator	in
	some cases.

2000-08-21 10:49  polandj

	* src/programs/rps_dist/: Makefile, mirror_update.c, rpsdist.c:

	* src/programs/IRRd/commands.c: The proper fix

2000-08-20 18:59  polandj

	* src/programs/IRRd/: commands.c, scan.c: Found the problem (I like
	purify):    We were calling mkstemp to create the update filename,
	then manually opening the file.  But, mkstemp opens the file for us
	(and we never closed it).  As a quick fix, I wrapped the called to
	mkstemp in a close.  Now that I think about it, it makes more sense
	to just open the fd to get the FILE *.	I wish I could cancel cvs
	checkins :)
	
	I'll do it right and check it in real soon

	mirror_update.c, rpsdist.c, select.c, update.c, user_update.c,
	utils.c: Basically just cleanup.  I didn't get the test machines up
	because I instead found a bug in IRRd I couldn't track down.  On
	updates, IRRd leaks file descriptors (i.e. isn't closing a file,
	per update).
	
	i.e. four consecutive updates: zippy# lsof | grep -c irrd 25 zippy#
	lsof | grep -c irrd 26 zippy# lsof | grep -c irrd 27 zippy# lsof |

	the new RPS-DIST mirroring code.  It supports all the RPS-DIST user
	updates, plus the following:   -  Supports out-of-order queueing  
	-  Supports automatically requesting missing transactions   -  Full
	PGP authorization between mirrors   -  The rest of the spec...
	
	Doesn't have:	-  Heartbeats	-  Transaction-request response
	(the spec is very weak here, I don't want      to code something
	that I know will kill the server.	i.e. "give me 0 - 10000,
	all gzip'd seperately")    -  Automatic PGP key generation (this
	would be nice! It would simplify the  code and the setup)   -  PGP
	keys are only entered into the keyring of the originating
	repository.  I'll need to fix this soon   -  Automatically adding a
	previously unheard of DB
	
	It's also not at all fully tested.  I can submit a route object via
	irr_submit to one repository and have it show up in the second.  By
	repository I mean rps_dist and IRRd.
	
	I'll do more mods today and tomorrow, as well as more testing. 
	Then monday I'll bring up a pair of test machines for everyone on
	the team to blast away at.

	I renamed the util.c file in IRRd to irrd_util.c again -- VisualC++

	the pipeline will run regardless of the configuration and give the
	user back a response.

	* bug fix in rpsl.y that could affect gpg keys.
	
	* re-did the cachedir_chks () routine and renamed   dir_chks () so
	that it could perform similar	checks on an arbitrary directory
	(not just the	cache directory).  Function   checks dir
	permissions and if you set a flag   will try and create the dir if
	it doesn't exit.
	
	* added 2 new irrd.conf commands:
	
	irr_database <db name> repos_hexid <hexid> irr_database <db name>
	pgppass <pgppass>
	
	   also added parallel support in read_conf.c.
	
	* added another routine to the pgp library 'pgp_free ()'   which
	(as the name implies) returns memory used in   an information
	struct that is passed between user and lib.
	
	* updated the 'pgp_fingerpr ()' function so that it detects   if a
	key is a signing key or not.
	
	* updated logic in the atomic ops lib so that it knew when   no
	backups were made and thus would not panic during a restore.   
	Such a situation might occur when bootstrapping irrd and    the
	user has not supplied an initial DB file.

	should it not exist.	- log any errors with with the DB directory
	on bootstrap,	   eg, insufficient permissions, couldn't create,

	* Put in code for newbies running in verbose mode that flags

	* updated irrd so that it uses the paths from autoconf for
	irrdcacher and wget if found.  Ditto for the atomic_ops lib for mv
	and cp.
	
	* did the last little bit of testing and fixing up of the
	irrdcacher fetching routines.  It's ready for team members to blast
	away at it.  We'd like to have this function as stable as possible

	IRRd 2.0.0 Alpha [08/01/2000] compiled on Aug  9 2000
	
	* updated irrdcacher and commands.c to send in conform to the new
	!B command, eg !B/var/tmp,rgnet
	
	Renamed the irrdcacher command flag '-c' for cache dir to '-t' for
	temp dir.
	
	* updated irrd so that if a DB is missing on bootstrap it tries to
	fetch it remotely by checking it's remote_ftp_dir irrd.conf value
	and then ftp://ftp.radb.net/radb/dbase if that doesn't work.  Also
	added an '-x' flag to override/skip this behavior if desired.
	
	Have a bug still to be worked out.  So stay away from the bootstrap
	auto-load feature for the moment.

	first step in mirroring code.	 - Mirroring is completely untested
	   - Just wanted to checkin to save it	  - Still needs logic to
	handle:        - Polling	- Heartbeat timers	  - Crash
	recovery	- Live addition of DB's        - Heartbeat checking
	   - Has logic to handle	- Queing out of order transactions
	(MAX 10)	- Stripping a completely specified mirror stream
	
	  - Much renaming to split up the routines better
	  - No changes to the user code (just changed files)

	* src/: config.status, include/pipeline_defs.h,
	programs/irr_submit/pgpchk.c: 
	* I updated the call to pgpv with a "+batchmode=1" parm to   to
	suppress interactive input.
	
	Note that this change is to our ancient pgp routine.  There is
	another pgp routine which has already been written will replace
	this one very soon.  The reason for not using the new routine is to
	avoid making too many changes at the same time, having already
	injected new 'PGPKEY-' processing code.

	* added the last two planned initial routines to our pgp lib:
	
	  pgp_sign_detached ()
	  pgp_sign_regular ()
	
	  I am through now with the initial cut of our lib.

	Finally! Fixed the netbsd (and linux) timer problem. Turned out to
	be a simple, but hard to catch bug. We block out thread signals
	when we start a UII connection. Turns out to be a bit of a race
	condition that only happens if running optimized (gcc -O) code, and
	(of course), you make a UII connection to the daemon at the right
	instant.
	
	Also did some cleanup (mktemp->mkstemp).

	irr_util/attr_tokens.pl, irr_util/create_templates.pl,
	irr_util/ripedb.config, irr_util/templates.config: 
	* Added comments to IRRd, et al... to outline the template  
	generating process and to make it easier next time to
	add/update/manage   object templates.
	
	* I created a script 'create_templates.pl' and an input file  
	templates.config which automatically creates the object   templates
	for ~IRRd/templates.c.	The idea is to make   adding, updating and
	managing the object templates easy by largly   automating the
	process.
	
	* Moved attr_tokens.pl and ripedb.config to the script directory  
	where they logically belonged.	They are used to generate   many of
	the data structures used by the parser.
	
	* Updated the README file to give a brief synopsis of each script  
	in the directory (since it was empty before :)

	update.  This code accounts for everything in  our proposed system
	for irr_submit/rps_dist/irrd integration.  Funcionality of this
	update:   -  Fixed rps_select bug   -  RPS DIST keeps it's own
	journal   -  Crash recovery (querying irrd for results after a
	crash is still	    untested)	-  A slew of other little things
	
	Next:	-  Change read_conf so pgp_dir is never NULL   -  Arrange
	and split the files in this directory into better categories   - 
	Start to re-work the mirror logic

	* fixed a couple bugs that jon pointed out
	
	* (hopefully) fixed the "repeated" operation bug jon   has been
	wrestling with.
	
	* updated the dist so that it would *not* build the ripe181 parser.
	   -the code is getting stale and this is the first step in
	deleting     the entire directory from the dist.

2000-07-26 20:03  polandj

	* src/programs/irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: Found the bug.  A different
	problem has evolved:  there seems to be a race condition somehow. 
	However, not sure that't it yet (could be my nasty code leaving
	files open and eating all the descriptors...:)	)  Will fix next...

	programs/irr_submit/call_pipeline.c, programs/irr_submit/comdata.c,
	programs/irr_submit/pgpchk.c, programs/pgp/pgp.c: 
	* updated our pgpdecodefile () routine to use the newly created pgp
	library.  Now all pgp invoking routines have been converted to use
	the pgp library.
	
	It is important to mention that the aforementioned functions have
	been duplicated from the originals and renamed "*_new".  The reason
	for this is to not impact the key-cert crossover this sunday. 
	After the crossover the new code can be migrated into production.
	
	* added pgp detached signature support for intitial submissions.

2000-07-26 01:23  polandj

	* src/programs/irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: Required modifications to get
	it to work.  Still one oddity:
	
	if you:   -  Add a new key successfully   -  Try to add it again,
	it fails.    -	Try it once more, it succeeds.
	
	this code works for adds and deletes, except in the above case. 
	Will look at it tomorrow (err...later today I guess) :)

2000-07-26 01:20  polandj

	* src/programs/pgp/pgp.c: Modified slightly..	  -  added

	* one or 2 minor bug fixes.
	
	* mainly I have added a new libpgp.a in our distribution.  This
	really cleans things up and allows us to support different versions
	of pgp if we wish.
	
	Not to scare anyone, but for the key-cert crossover we will not be
	using the new pgp lib.	The new lib will be phased in afrer the
	crossover.  For now we we will using the long tested pgp code
	(although messy).

2000-07-24 18:57  polandj

	* src/programs/irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: Changed two things:
	
	if( strcmp(curline, ADD_OP) )
	
	to
	
	if( strncmp(curline, ADD_OP, 3) )  to account for '\n'.
	
	also, added:  if( (newline = strchr(curline, '\n')) )	   
	*newline = '\0'; to get rid of the '\n' on the filename.
	
	Adding keys works now, we should be ok with removing if we change
	irr_submit to make the pgp file as: DEL <userid>

	* src/: include/irrd_ops.h, programs/irr_notify/notify.c,
	programs/irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: 
	Finished up the coding for irr_submit.	irr_submit is now ready to
	progress through the stages to rps dist:
	
	irr_submit invoked with the '-R' flag will cause it to progress
	through the rps dist path.  I also have the routines for the next
	phase, ie, irr_submit and IRRd are transaction capable.  Then of
	course the last step is to move to rps dist.
	
	1. finished the pgp processing.  Lame v5 does will not add keys
	from STDIN (contrary to the man pages) and this caused some
	headaches.
	
	2. Added some support routines, eg, querying irrd with the !j
	command.
	
	3. backing out of an aborted transaction.
	
	All messy stuff but necessary.

	programs/irr_submit/notifyif.c, programs/irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: 
	These changes are all in preparation for the conversion to atomic
	transactions and rps-dist.
	
	At present the code takes the current irr_submit update path (ie,
	the default).  However, if you specify the '-R' flag it will use
	the rps dist path.
	
	The first phase of the transtion will be to make irr_submit and
	irrd atomic transaction capable.  irr_submit is now transaction
	capable but irrd is not.  The irr_submit transaction code will not
	be used until irrd has been converted.
	
	Some highlights:
	
	* irr_submit reads the bcc transaction log to construct the rpsdist
	journal entry.
	
	* irr_submit send's 3 files rpsdist, a !us...!ue file for irrd, a
	pgp updates file and a journal entry file.
	
	* rpsdist will maintain the pgp rings and journal files.

2000-07-12 13:24  jeffhaas

	last database export.  o We track last database export (see above).
	   + Said information is available via !j - see COMMANDS.INFO	 +

	* added comments to the new routines I put in recently and updated
	the   header files so that tracing can occur in the parser.  Also
	did   some cosmetic cleaning up.  eg, removing commented out code
	that said   "take out...", ...

2000-06-21 10:58  jeffhaas

	* src/lib/mrt/trace.c: Fixed two problems.  1. trace_set_global
	really applies only to slave traces of the master that	  is passed
	in.  We were applying the new parameter to ALL slaves	 regardless
	who is the master.  2. When we use trace_copy and then set_trace to
	create a new trace that    has most of the same parameters, we
	weren't decreasing the refcount    on the original master trace.

	"!ms<support>" to update databases we're not authoritative for. 
	Other random stuff.  Next:    Checkin !ms irrd	  Checkin the added

	may have been causing us trouble.
	
	* in util.c I changed a few trace statements from 'NORM' to 'ERROR'
	ie, the mutex_lock () fail traces.
	
	* changed the syntax for ph and fax #'s.
	
	* loosened the syntax for handles.

2000-06-16 16:47  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/mirrorstatus.c: Made timeout 5 seconds for

	files in the pipeline which we definitely did not want.  Also fixed
	many of the nagging compiler warnings.	It has alway's been a
	mini-goal of mine to have clean builds.  I like clean builds and
	feel it has a positive impression on people using our software.
	
	* Improved the logging that the pipeline is doing.
	
	* Fixed the scan routine so that it accepts trailing comments on
	objects. It was chopping them off. (Jeff pointed this out)

	uii_commands.c: 
	Added "no debug server verbose" Added "irr_database remote_ftp_dir"
	config entry for irrdcacher integreation Added "irrdcacher
	<database>" uii command

2000-06-08 12:40  labovit

	* src/include/: config.h, version.h: 
	config.h should not be part of CVS.  Upped the version date.

2000-06-08 12:39  labovit

	* src/config.status: 
	This file should not be part of CVS...

2000-06-06 16:36  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/commands.c: Cleaned up potential buffer
	overflows in set_sources.  Removed commented code.

2000-06-06 16:35  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/: irrd.h, journal.c, mirrorstatus.c: The buffer
	overflow length checking wasn't doing a MAX(0,curlength - copied
	length)

2000-06-06 12:57  gerald

	* src/programs/: IRRd/commands.c, irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.y: 
	* I realaxed the syntax checking rules on phone numbers and fax's. 
	The spec is much too restictive and is definitely a mistake as it
	was causing people a lot of headaches (ie, they had no idea they
	were supposed to include country code and city code into their
	numbers) and was not accepting numbers like:
	
	+1 713 793 0222
	
	* I did not change commands.c.	I did some testing and did not fold
	in any changes.

2000-06-05 17:13  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/mirrorstatus.c: Better uii support for "show
	mirror-status"

2000-06-05 12:01  gerald

	* src/programs/: hdr_comm/read_conf.c, irr_notify/notify_msgs.c,
	irr_notify/util.c: 
	* fixed a bug which occasionally was sending a redundant notify to
	the sender of an update.  Added some logging statements to identify
	who is getting what type of notification.
	
	* took out some useless logging statement from read_conf.c

2000-06-04 11:41  gerald

	* src/: config.status, include/config.h, programs/IRRd/scan.c: 
	Bug squash, file descriptor overflow.  Somehow we were not closing
	the *.CURRENTSERIAL file whenver we read it.  So everytime a !B was
	executed we would reopen the file -- again and again.

2000-06-02 18:57  gerald

	* src/: include/irr_rpsl_check.h,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/canonical.c,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.fl, programs/irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.y,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/syntax_attrs.c,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/util.c: 
	* Worked on the 'changed:' attribute.	 - removed warning for
	providing a date in the future	    and automatically put in the
	current date	  (this was a real annoyance for our Australian
	friends)    - if you provide only your email address the parser    
	 will add today's date for you automatically	- if you make an
	error on the date a warning is given	  and the current date is
	supplied.
	
	* More word on objects canonicalization.  Mainly on line  
	continuation and doing a better job.  Fixed a bug also.
	
	* Changed syntax on override password to accept only the password  
	(ie, name of submitter is not required)   - Added string trim so
	trailing spaces are removed
	
	* Added string trim feature where applicable.  Most notably   if
	you add 100's of spaces on the end of a field which has   no syntax
	(eg, 'descr:') the parser will trim up to the last   printable
	character.    (people occasionally submit objects like this and it
	looks terrible,     as if there is a blank line in the middle of
	the object)
	
	Many of today's fixes came from going through the logs and
	observing what people are actually doing.

2000-06-02 17:21  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/: irrd.h, mirrorstatus.c: You always find the
	bugs _after_ you do the commit.  Various fixes for mirror-status -
	slightly better UII and fixed broken behaviour for down remote
	database.

2000-06-02 16:52  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/: Makefile, irrd.h, irrd_prototypes.h, main.c,
	mirrorstatus.c: Added the functionality to query !j from remote
	databases via the get_remote_mirrorstatus function.  This can be
	used later on internally to reseed databases automatically.
	
	Also added the "show mirror-status" uii command.  The output is a
	little rough - will await feedback from group.

2000-06-01 21:14  gerald

	* src/: config.status, configure, configure.in, include/config.h,
	include/config.h.in, programs/IRRd/Makefile: 
	After a lot of pain, I got this stupid thing to build on a freebsd
	4.0.
	
	Also, we had an unecessary dependence on libhdr_comm.a in IRRd
	which was removed.

2000-06-01 18:10  labovit

	* src/lib/mrt/trace.c: 
	Append is turned on by default.

2000-06-01 16:04  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/telnet.c: Jerry's addition of
	irr_read_command_schedule produced a compiler warning when pthreads
	is not installed.

2000-06-01 11:41  gerald

	* src/: config.status, configure, configure.in, include/config.h: 
	Fixed that nagging build bug in which we were building IRRd before
	building the libhdr.a lib which IRRd uses.

2000-06-01 11:38  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/: COMMANDS.INFO, commands.c: Added !j support. 
	!j support documented in COMMANDS.INFO

2000-06-01 11:11  gerald

	* src/: config.status, configure, configure.in, include/config.h,
	include/config.h.in, include/mrt.h, include/mrt_thread.h,
	include/timer.h, lib/mrt/trace.c: 
	Modified the configure script so that the dist builds on a freebsd
	4.0.

2000-06-01 01:44  labovit

	* src/programs/IRRd/: Makefile, telnet.c: 
	Fixed FreeBSD thread core dump problem.
	
	The issue was that irrd2.0 is built on the latest MRT thread
	libraries. For the first time, non-threaded programs have thread
	accounting/bookeeping. This is actually a good thing.
	
	The problem was that the irrd telnet thread registered a select
	callback (irr_read_command).  The irr_read_comand routing was
	called from the main select thread (thread 10, by default).  In
	turn, we would call thread_exit from irr_read_command which was
	still under the purview of  thread 10.	This is okay the first time
	around, but we catch an assert the second time we try to delete
	thread 10.
	
	Fixed by actually scheduling irr_read processing instead of calling
	directly from select. Minor nit.

2000-05-31 15:36  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/irrd_prototypes.h: Prototypes for new
	functions, and prototypes for other functions that were getting
	compiler warnings otherwise.

2000-05-31 15:35  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/journal.c: Related piece of database.c update -
	the function to determine last journal serial number.

2000-05-31 14:58  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/database.c: Lots of changes here: - dbclean
	functionality now only allows 1 line between objects when cleaning.
	   It also no longer takes two passes to clean up blank lines after
	object	  deletion.  - Got rid of some compiler warnings.  - Added
	warning via trace when database is empty.  - On database load, if
	journal files are present for a mirrored or   authoritative
	database, it verifies the CURRENTSERIAL >= the last journal  
	number.  Otherwise an error is logged.	Function provides a useful 
	 return value so stronger action could be taken.  - Logged a couple
	additional TODO's:   + Stronger action needed on failed fseek on
	database read.	  + Gzipping is required by this module.  Gzipping
	the output is optional	    and shouldn't be a cause for failure in
	export.  Whether or not      the zipping is required should be
	configurable.

2000-05-31 13:41  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/util.c: Removed the #ifdefs on the traces.	MRT
	Trace library already gives us what we need (verbose option - shut
	it off!)

2000-05-31 12:04  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/dbm_support.c: Added some comments.

2000-05-31 10:53  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/scan.c: Cleaned up some file opening code.

2000-05-31 10:34  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/util.c: #ifdef'd out the majority of the
	tracing for database locking and unlocking.  The error conditions
	remain.  The additional logging can be re-enabled by adding #define
	LOG_ALL_LOCKING 1 to the file.

2000-05-31 10:32  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/irrd_util.c: This file appears to be dead.

2000-05-30 17:34  gerald

	* src/: include/config.h, programs/irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.fl: 
	Fixed a parsing error on the 'key-cert' object.

2000-05-30 16:21  polandj

	* src/programs/rps_dist/: commands.c, rps.c, rps_daemon.c,
	rps_select.c: Found my mistake.

2000-05-30 13:59  polandj

	* src/programs/rps_dist/: Makefile, commands.c, read_conf.c, rps.c,
	rps.h, rps_daemon.c, rps_select.c: Checking in latest stuff before
	I go back through and clean it up.  Still a lingering bug, I think
	it's a threading issue, but should locate it soon.

2000-05-30 11:47  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/scan.c: Fixed scan_irr_serial function so it is
	guaranteed to return a good value in db structure.  0 is okay if
	serial file doesn't exist.  Return value of function reflects
	whether or not the file exists or not.	The calls to this function
	currently don't look at return value, but that's okay right now (at
	least in IRRd).

2000-05-30 11:43  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/telnet.c: Fixed comments to be ANSI standard
	(not C++) Fixed compiler warnings.  Function irr_write needs
	auditing.  See JMH TODO

2000-05-30 11:42  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/uii_commands.c: Made comments ANSI standard
	(not C++) Fixed compiler warnings.  Trace output using strftime %D
	parameter - compiler was throwing Y2K warnings.  This has been
	changed.

2000-05-30 11:41  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/main.c: Fixed comments to ANSI standard (not
	C++).  Removed compiler warnings.

2000-05-30 11:40  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/irrd.h: last_char variable was (char *) and is
	now (char).  Fixed buglet in unused util.c code.

2000-05-30 11:39  jeffhaas

	* src/programs/IRRd/config.c: database_t wasn't being init'd to
	zero!

	programs/irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.fl, programs/irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.y,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/util.c: 
	* Fixed a buffer overlfow bug in the my_strcat () routine.  You can
	have arbitrarily long attributes.  However, if a threshold is
	exceeded canonicalization is turned off for that attribute and the
	attribute is used verbatim as the user typed it.
	
	* Did some clean up (Jeff is doing clean up, sounds like a good
	thing :)
	
	* Added comments to certain funtions.

2000-05-24 17:18  gerald

	* src/programs/irr_rpsl_check/: main.c, rpsl.fl, rpsl.y,
	syntax_attrs.c, util.c: 
	Just making sure my latest changes are checked in.

2000-05-23 20:01  gerald

	programs/irr_submit/call_pipeline.c,
	programs/irr_submit/notifyif.c, programs/irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: 
	* added jeff's syntax fix for the irrorder attribute.
	
	* added support to add key certificates to the local ring.
	
	* more twiddling with object canonicalization.
	
	I have been doing full pipeline testing with key-cert objects.	The
	canonicalization is what is taking the extra testing time.
	
	I'll probably roll out the new code on the prodcution server if all
	goes well tomorrow.

2000-05-20 18:50  gerald

	* Fixed autoconf so that...	- will not consider berkeley DB for
	an IRRd db package     - IRRd will build on systems that don't have
	GDBM
	
	* Modified IRRd so that if no DB packages are available it   will
	default to memory mode.
	
	* Added 'key-cert:' object support to IRRd.
	
	* Added 'PGPKEY-xxxxxxx' authentication checking to the pipeline.
	
	* Did some more twiddling with the parser canonicalization.

2000-05-18 16:14  gerald

	* src/: include/irr_rpsl_check.h,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/canonical.c,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.fl, programs/irr_rpsl_check/rpsl.y,
	programs/irr_rpsl_check/util.c: 
	* Just about finished off support for key-cert objects and
	auto-management of pgp key's.  The parsing/checking is done.  All
	that's left is to actually add the object to irrd's local key ring.
	
	* I've got canonicalization of rpsl objects looking pretty good. 
	Have not done extensive testing but will do so this weekend. 
	Should have it up on the production server early next week.

	programs/irr_rpsl_check/util.c: 
	Checking in yesterday's work.
	
	* Added support for machine generated fields.  there are 3 such
	fields in a key-cert object (method, owner(s), key fingerprint). 
	Still need to be able to remove the aforementioned fields if the
	user provides them, then will be done with this task.
	
	* Added support back in for canonicalization of rpsl objects
	(woo-hoo!).  It is not finished yet, though.

2000-05-16 14:22  gerald

	pgpv paths.
	
	* minor bug fix in comdata.c.  String for ending PGP signature was
	incomplete and could match many other messages.
	
	* bulk of changes are in the syntax checker.  start of code for pgp
	signature object support.  Not done yet though.

2000-05-02 16:42  polandj

	* src/programs/rps_dist/: commands.c, commands.h, rps.c: Files
	removed from the core IRRd.  rps.c is the same, the others are
	fragments from parsing and header files.

2000-05-02 16:27  polandj

	* src/: include/config.h, programs/IRRd/Makefile,
	programs/IRRd/commands.c, programs/IRRd/irrd.h,
	programs/IRRd/irrd_prototypes.h, programs/IRRd/main.c,

2000-05-02 16:26  polandj

	* src/config.status: Should this file be in CVS?

2000-04-24 20:31  gerald

	* src/programs/: irr_submit/auth.c, irr_submit/comdata.c,
	irr_submit/trans_list.c, irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: 
	Got rid of 2 bugs.  One bug would return error messages from
	irr_rpsl_submit of 'Connection refused' when irrd was up and
	running.
	
	The other bug squash was irrd was not allowing some updates because
	of a internal connection status mixup.

2000-04-24 20:29  gerald

	* src/programs/IRRd/: commands.c, irrd.h, scan.c, scan.h: 
	I fixed a bug in which irrd was not recognizing the new rpsl set
	objects such as peeering-set and rtr-set.  The bug would cause irrd
	to dump the objects on bootstrap since irrd thought they were junk.

2000-04-24 20:26  gerald

	* src/: config.status, include/config.h: 
	I did not update this file directly .

	* src/programs/IRRd/: irrd_prototypes.h, rps.c: Just checking in
	the latest, pgp checking/signing works between two repositories,
	will check 3 later.

2000-03-28 12:00  polandj

	* src/programs/irrd_ops/irrd_ops.c: Fixed the problem of bad
	connections being interpreted as a missing maintainer.	The
	problem, I don't think, wasn't actually that the connection is
	refused, but is accepted and not handled by IRRd.  So irr_submit
	would send commands, but never get anything back.  It then assumed
	that since it got nothing back (a read timeout), that the operation
	was an ADD.  There was no way to report errors from the function
	IRRd_fetch_object back to calling functions.
	
	This should be re-done when we modify the pipeline for rps dist.

2000-03-25 16:35  polandj

	* src/programs/irr_util/web_query.pl: Just adding the web query
	Perl script.

2000-03-20 21:36  polandj

	* src/programs/IRRd/: irrd_prototypes.h, rps.c: Works much better
	now:
	
	Redid the gzip/gunzip code for simpler operation.  Added in the PGP
	checking and PGP signing code:	   PGP checking works, for one
	signature only (at the moment).      PGP signing on behalf of the
	repository is done, neglecting choices of	   PGP version, and
	signing identity (assumes default for now)
	
	Next steps:    Put timers around the calls to PGP, gzip, and
	gunzip.     Fix checking on initial submissions (it doesn't check
	the timestamp)	   See if two mirrors can ditribute transactions
	amongst themselves...fully	  RPS-DIST compliantly.     If that
	works, it should be no problem making a mirror that accepts	  
	current mirroring, and outputs RPS-DIST mirroring.

	* src/programs/IRRd/: Makefile, commands.c, irrd.h,
	irrd_prototypes.h, main.c, rps.c, telnet.c: Merging the RPS DIST

	* src/: Make.include.in, include/config.h, include/version.h,
	lib/mrt/connect.c, lib/mrt/select.c, programs/IRRd/Makefile,
	programs/IRRd/commands.c, programs/IRRd/main.c,
	programs/IRRd/mirror.c: 
	Fixed deadlock problem -- we called select_start twice (once in
	IRRd and once in mrt-start). Simple fix, but took hours to figure
	out... (sigh)

2000-03-01 20:57  labovit

	* src/programs/IRRd/: irrd_prototypes.h, mirror.c: 
	Bug fix.

	Fixed problem with show_database command and added requested totals
	feature.  Still looks like there is a serious bug in mirroring
	code..
